Radar Display
The radar display is a graphical interface that shows the position and distance of the targets in real time. It uses the following components and concepts:
* Ultrasonic Sensor: This sensor emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time it takes for them to bounce back from an object. It calculates the distance of the object based on the speed of sound and the time of flight. It also detects the angle of the object by rotating on a servo motor.
* Arduino Integration: The Arduino board acts as the intermediary between the radar system and the mobile device. It manages the communication protocol, ensuring smooth and reliable data transmission. Additionally, it processes data from sensors to generate real-time updates on the radar display.
* IoT: This concept enables the communication between the Arduino and the mobile device, such as a computer or a smartphone. It uses a wireless module, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to transmit the data over the internet. The mobile device then receives the data and shows it on a graphical interface using a web browser or an app.
* Processing: This is a software platform that allows creating and running graphical applications. It is used to create the radar display interface that shows the data from the Arduino in a visual and interactive way.
The radar display uses the concept of IoT to display on our screen and give an alert when an obstacle is close. It uses ultrasonic sensor, Arduino, and Processing to achieve real-time data visualization.
Gun Mechanism
The gun mechanism in our project is engineered to deliver precision and automation in targeting. Unlike traditional manual potentiometers, we employ servo motors for aiming control. This strategic choice ensures swift and precise adjustments, leading to accurate targeting. The gun mechanism uses the following components and functions:
* Servo Motors for Aiming and Triggering: The heart of our targeting system lies in the deployment of two servo motors, each serving a distinct purpose:
   * Aiming Control: One servo motor is dedicated to the aiming mechanism. This motor allows controlled movement along the horizontal and vertical axes, facilitating precise targeting adjustments. It receives the position and distance data from the Arduino and adjusts the angle of the gun accordingly.
   * Trigger Mechanism: The second servo motor is employed for the trigger mechanism. It is responsible for pulling the string back, preparing the gun for firing. Additionally, this servo motor acts as a latch, releasing upon command to initiate firing.
* Laser: This component is attached to the gun barrel and emits a laser beam that indicates the direction of the gun. It helps to align the gun with the target and provides visual feedback.
* Infra Red Sensor: This sensor detects the presence of motion in front of the gun. It sends a signal to the Arduino when it senses a moving target. It also acts as a safety feature, preventing the gun from firing when there is no motion detected.
* Spring for Magazine Unloading: This component is attached to the magazine of the gun and pushes the bullets forward. It ensures that the gun is always loaded and ready to fire.
The gun mechanism is designed to shoot at the targets detected by the radar display. It uses servo motors, sensors, and a laser to achieve automation and precision.
Arduino Integration
The Arduino board acts as the central control hub for our targeting system. It orchestrates communication and coordination between the various components. Here’s how it functions:
* Motor Control: The Arduino board provides the necessary signals to the servo motors, dictating their positions and movements. This ensures synchronized operation, allowing for precise aiming and firing.
* Sensor Feedback: The Arduino interprets the sensor readings and adjusts motor positions accordingly. It uses the data from the ultrasonic sensor to determine the position and distance of the target. It also uses the data from the infra red sensor to detect motion and trigger the firing sequence.
* Triggering Logic: The Arduino processes input commands for triggering. When the command to fire is received, it instructs the trigger servo motor to release, initiating the firing sequence.
* Communication Protocol: The Arduino board manages the communication protocol to ensure seamless data transmission to the display device. It uses a wireless module, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to send the data over the internet. The display device then receives the data and shows it on the radar display interface.
By leveraging the capabilities of the Arduino board, we create a cohesive and responsive targeting system that combines automation with precision.
Triggering System
The triggering system is a critical component designed for seamless and reliable firing. It employs a two-step process facilitated by servo motors and a robust mechanical design:
* String Retraction Servo: This servo motor is responsible for pulling the string back, preparing the gun for firing. The Arduino board facilitates precise control over the servo, ensuring consistent and reliable string retraction.
* Firing Latch Servo: The second servo motor acts as a latch mechanism that can be triggered on command. Once activated, it releases the primed mechanism, initiating the firing process. The Arduino plays a pivotal role in coordinating the timing and execution of this crucial step.
* Arduino Integration: The Arduino board serves as the central nervous system of the triggering system. It provides the necessary signals and timing to the servo motors, ensuring synchronized operation. Additionally, it processes input commands for triggering, facilitating a seamless and responsive firing mechanism.
The triggering system is designed to shoot at the targets detected by the radar display. It uses servo motors and Arduino to achieve automation and precision.




Laser Guidance
Precision targeting is paramount, and our laser guidance system is engineered to deliver just that. A laser module, strategically positioned below the gun, provides a clear visual reference for targeting. The Arduino board ensures that the laser is activated and aligned with the gun’s orientation. The laser guidance system uses the following components and functions:
* Laser Module: This component is attached to the gun barrel and emits a laser beam that indicates the direction of the gun. It helps to align the gun with the target and provides visual feedback.
* Arduino Integration: The Arduino board controls the activation and alignment of the laser module. It interprets data from sensors and servo motors to ensure accurate laser targeting. This integration guarantees that the laser guidance system operates in sync with the overall targeting system.
The laser guidance system is designed to enhance the accuracy and precision of the targeting system. It uses a laser module and Arduino to achieve this goal.
