# RISC-V-Hackathon


# RVPdH Stage 1- Product Idea Submission Form

Welcome to the RISC-V Product Development Hackathon's product idea submission platform. This form is crafted to capture the essence and innovation behind your product idea. As you navigate through the questions, envision them as a structured blueprint to help articulate and streamline your concept. For example, if you're designing a toy car that uses sensor-based technology to follow a light source, clearly describe its functionality, the sensors it necessitates, and how the VSDSquadron board integrates within its framework.

Whether you're on a quest to revolutionize the domain of educational toys or poised to usher in a groundbreaking IoT-based marvel, this is your platform to manifest your vision. So, roll up your sleeves, and together, let's champion the cause of Made-in-India products that resonate on a global scale!

## Understanding the Judging Criteria:

- **Logic Clarity:** Judges will assess the straightforwardness of product's underlying logic. For example, if designing a light-responsive toy, how directly does it react to light changes?
- **Working Block Diagram:** Block diagram should visually depict how different product elements function together. For a toy car, it should show the flow from light detection to motion.
- **Clarity on Sensor and Interfaces Usage on VSDSquadron:** Clearly define how you're using the VSDSquadron board's features, detailing sensor connections and interface utilization.
- **Product Innovation:** What makes your product unique? Judges will look for innovative features that differentiate your creation in the market. Consider how your product offers something new or distinct.
